"Term of Service. Your Agreement begins on the day we activate your Service(s) and continues through the Term of Service, typically a 12 month or 24 month period (""Service Commitment""), specified on your Customer Service Summary. At the end of your service commitment, this Agreement will automatically continue on a month-to-month basis. If your Agreement has no Service Commitment, it is a month-to-month Agreement.",0,63
"Device Activation. If You purchased a device that was shipped to You, You agree to activate the device within seven (7) days of the shipment date. If Your device is not activated by You, we may activate the device for You within a month of shipping and Your monthly recurring charges, and any applicable Service Commitment, will begin.",0,57
"Fulfillment of Service Commitment. You have received certain benefits from us in exchange for your Service Commitment, which may include, but are not limited to, a subsidized wireless device. There are two alternative ways to fulfill your Service Commitment. You can pay for the Services described in your Customer Service Summary for the term of your Service Commitment, or you can terminate your Agreement prior to the end of your Service Commitment and pay an Early Termination Fee (""ETF""). The Early Termination Fee is not a penalty, but rather is an alternative means for you to perform your obligations under the Agreement that partially compensates us for the fact that the Service Commitment on which your rate plan is based was not completed.",0,122
Your Termination Rights,0,2
" Within the first 14 days after service activation, you may terminate your Agreement for any reason and not be required to pay an ETF",0,24

 Some dealers may impose additional fees,0,6
"After the first 14 days, you may terminate your Agreement for any reason. However, you agree to pay Acme for all fees, charges, and other amounts incurred and owed under your Agreement along with the applicable ETF. The Early Termination Fee is either: (a) $325 or (b) $150. The ETF reduces each full month of your Service Commitment that you complete. To determine whether your Equipment has a $325 Early Termination Fee or a $150 Early Termination Fee, and the amount of reduction, check /equipmentETF.",0,84
"After your Service Commitment ends and you are on a month-to-month Agreement, you may terminate your Agreement at any time with 30 days notice without incurring an ETF. If you sign a new Agreement before the end of the term of your existing Agreement and terminate that new Agreement within 14 days as allowed above, you agree that you will be bound by the terms and conditions of your existing Agreement including fulfillment of any remaining Service Commitment thereunder.",0,78

" This could include charges, discounts, coverage, technologies, and other Service terms",0,11
 We commit that we’ll provide you with notice either in your monthly bill or separately at least 30 days before we make any materially adverse change,0,26
" So, for instance, if we increase your rate plan or the price of any of your Services more than what we’ve previously told you (such as in your Customer Service Summary) those would be materially adverse changes",0,37

"If you select a rate plan that includes a predetermined allotment of Services (for example, a predetermined amount of airtime, megabytes or messages), unless otherwise specifically provided as a part of such rate plan, any unused allotment of Services from one billing cycle will not carry over to any other billing cycle. We may bill you in a format as we determine from time to time. Additional charges may apply for additional copies of your bill, or for detailed information about your usage of Services.",0,84
"Delayed Billing: Billing of usage for calls, messages, data or other Services (such as usage when roaming on other carriers' networks, including internationally) may occasionally be delayed. Such usage charges may appear in a later billing cycle, will be deducted from Anytime monthly minutes or other Services allotments for the month when the usage is actually billed, and may result in additional charges for that month. Those minutes will be applied against your Anytime monthly minutes in the month in which the calls appear on your bill.

2.0 HOW DO I RESOLVE DISPUTES WITH Acme?,0,7
2.1 Dispute Resolution By Binding Arbitration,0,5
PLEASE READ THIS CAREFULLY. IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS.,0,7
Summary:,0,0
Most customer concerns can be resolved quickly and to the customer's satisfaction by calling our customer service department at ,0,19
" In the unlikely event that Acme's customer service department is unable to resolve a complaint you may have to your satisfaction (or if Acme has not been able to resolve a dispute it has with you after attempting to do so informally), we each agree to resolve those disputes through binding arbitration or small claims court instead of in courts of general jurisdiction",0,63
 Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court,0,9
" Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, allows for more limited discovery than in court, and is subject to very limited review by courts",0,28
 Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award,0,13
 Any arbitration under this Agreement will take place on an individual basis; class arbitrations and class actions are not permitted,0,20
" For any non-frivolous claim that does not exceed $75,000, Acme will pay all costs of the arbitration",0,17
" Moreover, in arbitration you are entitled to recover attorneys' fees from Acme to at least the same extent as you would be in court",0,24
"In addition, under certain circumstances (as explained below), Acme will pay you more than the amount of the arbitrator's award and will pay your attorney (if any) twice his or her reasonable attorneys' fees if the arbitrator awards you an amount that is greater than what Acme has offered you to settle the dispute.",0,53
2.2 Arbitration Agreement,0,2
"Acme and you agree to arbitrate all disputes and claims between us. This agreement to arbitrate is intended to be broadly interpreted. It includes, but is not limited to:",0,28

"claims that arose before this or any prior Agreement (including, but not limited to, claims relating to advertising);",0,17
claims that are currently the subject of purported class action litigation in which you are not a member of a certified class; and,0,22
claims that may arise after the termination of this Agreement.,0,9
"References to ""Acme,"" ""you,"" and ""us"" include our respective subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors in interest, successors, and assigns, as well as all authorized or unauthorized users or beneficiaries of services or Devices under this or prior Agreements between us",0,39
" Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may bring an individual action in small claims court",0,14
" This arbitration agreement does not preclude you from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies, including, for example, the Federal Communications Commission",0,26
" Such agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf",0,14
" You agree that, by entering into this Agreement, you and Acme are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action",0,28
" This Agreement evidences a transaction in interstate commerce, and thus the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision",0,22
 This arbitration provision shall survive termination of this Agreement,0,9
"A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a written Notice of Dispute (""Notice"")",0,21
" The Notice to Acme should be addressed to: Office for Dispute Resolution, Acme,",0,17
", (""Notice Address"")",0,5
" The Notice must (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (b) set forth the specific relief sought (""Demand"")",0,23
" If Acme and you do not reach an agreement to resolve the claim within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or Acme may commence an arbitration proceeding",0,29
" During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by Acme or you shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to which you or Acme is entitled",0,37
 You may download or copy a form Notice and a form to initiate arbitration at att,0,16
com/arbitration-forms,0,0
"After Acme receives notice at the Notice Address that you have commenced arbitration, it will promptly reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for greater than $75,000",0,32
" (The filing fee currently is $200 for claims under $10,000 but is subject to change by the arbitration provider",0,19
" If you are unable to pay this fee, Acme will pay it directly upon receiving a written request at the Notice Address",0,22
") The arbitration will be governed by the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, ""AAA Rules"") of the American Arbitration Association (""AAA""), as modified by this Agreement, and will be administered by the AAA",0,39
 The AAA Rules are available online at adr,0,8
"org, by calling the AAA at , or by writing to the Notice Address",0,13
 (You may obtain information that is designed for non-lawyers about the arbitration process at att,0,15
com/arbitration-information,0,0
) The arbitrator is bound by the terms of this Agreement,0,10
" All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, except that issues relating to the scope and enforceability of the arbitration provision are for the court to decide",0,27
" Unless Acme and you agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) of your billing address",0,21
" If your claim is for $10,000 or less, we agree that you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules",0,45
" If your claim exceeds $10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules",0,17
" Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based",0,32
" Except as otherwise provided for herein, Acme will pay all AAA filing, administration, and arbitrator fees for any arbitration initiated in accordance with the notice requirements above",0,27
" If, however, the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all such fees will be governed by the AAA Rules",0,55
" In such case, you agree to reimburse Acme for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules",0,26
" In addition, if you initiate an arbitration in which you seek more than $75,000 in damages, the payment of these fees will be governed by the AAA rules",0,28
"If, after finding in your favor in any respect on the merits of your claim, the arbitrator issues you an award that is greater than the value of Acme's last written settlement offer made before an arbitrator was selected, then Acme will:",0,41
"pay you the amount of the award or $10,000 (""the alternative payment""), whichever is greater; and",0,15
"pay your attorney, if any, twice the amount of attorneys' fees, and reimburse any expenses (including expert witness fees and costs) that your attorney reasonably accrues for investigating, preparing, and pursuing your claim in arbitration (""the attorney premium"").",0,37
"If Acme did not make a written offer to settle the dispute before an arbitrator was selected, you and your attorney will be entitled to receive the alternative payment and the attorney premium, respectively, if the arbitrator awards you any relief on the merits. The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees, expenses, and the alternative payment and the attorney premium at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator's ruling on the merits.",0,91
"The right to attorneys' fees and expenses discussed in paragraph (4) supplements any right to attorneys' fees and expenses you may have under applicable law. Thus, if you would be entitled to a larger amount under the applicable law, this provision does not preclude the arbitrator from awarding you that amount. However, you may not recover duplicative awards of attorneys' fees or costs. Although under some laws Acme may have a right to an award of attorneys' fees and expenses if it prevails in an arbitration, Acme agrees that it will not seek such an award.",0,95
"The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim. YOU AND Acme AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and Acme agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. If this specific provision is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void.",0,118
"Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, we agree that if Acme makes any future change to this arbitration provision (other than a change to the Notice Address) during your Service Commitment, you may reject any such change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to the Arbitration Notice Address provided above. By rejecting any future change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any dispute between us in accordance with the language of this provision.",0,81
